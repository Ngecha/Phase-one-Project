# Phase-1-Project
This is the project done by Dennis Kimani as required for the completion of the first section of Software Engineering course <a href="https://moringaschool.com/" target="_blank">Moringa School</a>, Nairobi.

## Mobile App
The objective of this project is to provide the user with a site where they can obtain details of any-phone. The main aim of the project is to provide a site where a user can log-in, search any phone and get accurate specifications of the device and get a link to an e-commerce site to purchase the selected device.Currently the site has eight devices in the database. To increase the database, we have given the user a form that after filling, it adds to the database. To view the main specifications of the current devices, just click on the name of the device.<br> <br>
## Browser Version
To run the project directly on the browser use<a href="https://phenomenal-bonbon-ba45ff.netlify.app">this link</a>. To ensure accurate rendering of the website, ensure that the local host is watching the db.json file in the repository.
